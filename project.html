            <p>Even if the cloud storage and orgnaization market is a decade old the use of online tools is increasing with the rise of remote work and online collaboration. Link wants to create a customizable, welcoming and intuitive interface that the users want to use. It serves as a linking force between people and helps organize files from other online apps.</p>

            <p>Through market and user research I identified that young users were using multiple online apps and were in need of easy interfaces, a greater selection of customizable featuers and visual design tools. Hence, I targeted the young creative general public, who were looking to organize, share and collaborate online.

          <p>I researched their history, target audience, and differentiators and when I examined their weaknesses I noticed an overlap with the participants' frustrations from the user survey.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Drive didn’t support many formats.</li>
          <li>Evernote wasn’t flexible with its layout and lacked storage in the free version.</li>
          <li>Slack and Google Drive had limited history and file search options.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Motivations</h3>
            <p>Susan worries about the lack of safety measures for online files.  She uses Zoom when she teaches remotely and really likes the platform. She has a strong habit of writing things down by hand and organizing infromation by color and shape. The online apps don’t give her much creative freedom, and that’s why she doesn’t use them. Some younger co-workers use online collaboration apps but most teachers don’t, so she doesn’t know much about them.</p>

          <p>When the tasks pathways were unknown to me, I studied other websites observing their processes carefully to adjust my own.</p>
          <p>After the user flows, I devised the content strategy. First, a sitemap was drawn out based on the user flows, which displayed all of the apps pages and features.</p>
        <a href="project.html"><img id="site-map" src="../images/site-map.png" alt="site-map"></a>

<!--Wireframes-->
      <section class="wireframes" id="wireframes">
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
          <p>Initially, I sketched variations of screens on paper, to test and determine where to best position content such as, buttons, bars and images.</p>
        <div class="wireframe-sketches">
          <a href="project.html"><img id="sketches1" src="../images/sketches1.png" alt="sketches1"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="sketches2" src="../images/sketches2.png" alt="sketches2"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="sketches3" src="../images/sketches3.png" alt="sketches3"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="sketches4" src="../images/sketches4.png" alt="sketches4"></a>

          <a href="project.html"><img id="sketches6" src="../images/sketches6.png" alt="sketches6"></a>
        </div>
          <p>Once the screens were complete, I digitilized the sketches in Figma.</p>
        <div class="wirframe-digital">
          <a href="project.html"><img id="wireframe1" src="../images/wireframe1.png" alt="wireframe1"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="wireframe2" src="../images/wireframe2.png" alt="wireframe2"></a>

        </div>
          <p>Some of the challenges at this stage inlcuded deciding where to place the visual components, features, icons and text. To solve this, I studied many apps and seeked professional advice from my mentor. After a couple of iterations, the screens started to come together.</p>
          <p>Next, I recognized that the base font was too large and all the sections were inflated. I proceeded to resize the elements and decrease the whitespace between them.</p>

        <h2>Branding</h2>
          <p>First, I brainstormed and made lists and quick sketches of imagery and emotions that related to the apps function and mood. I decided to call the product Link because it connects people and supports collaboration, serving as a linking force.</p>
          <p>Following market research, variations of Link’s logos were created by sketching and later digital iterations in Illustrator.</p>
        <div class="logo">
          <a href="project.html"><img id="logo-brainstorming" src="../images/logo-brainstorming.png" alt="logo-brainstorming"></a>

          <a href="project.html"><img id="variations2" src="../images/variations2.png" alt="variations2"></a>
        </div>
          <p>A geometric and simple logo was chosen. The first letter ‘L’,  has paths crossing through it representing an intersection and connection, which is what the product aims to do for its users.</p>
        <a href="project.html"><img id="link-logo" src="../images/link-logo.png" alt="link-logo"></a>
          <p>After the logo, the typography was chosen and a moodboard presentation template created in Sketch, where I used gender-neutral colors and welcoming and organic imagery.</p>
          <p>The complementary hues of orange and blue were intended to be  welcoming and motivating. The moodboard set the tone for the style guide and all visual elements.</p>
        <a href="project.html"><img id="moodboard" src="../images/moodboard.png" alt="moodboard"></a>
          <p>Initially the brand typeface was Libre Franklin and the complementary typeface was a simple non-serif Galvji. After some consideration I increased the contrast and readability between the typefaces by changing the brand typeface to a serif, called Merriweather.</p>
        <div class="type">
          <a href="project.html"><img id="type1" src="../images/type1.png" alt="type1"></a>

        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
          <p>To make prototyping possible I first created high fidelity mock-ups in Figma, where I added color, images and icons to the wireframes.</p>
          <p>The mockups were reiterated multiple times where I adjusted the relative sizes of the elements and their design. Additionally, I added a variety of visual cues and overlays to enhance the clarity and contrast between the components, thereby improving the UI.</p>

          <p>Next, I uploaded the high fidelity mock ups to InVision and connected the screens  so that they would be ready for usability testing.</p>
        <div class="preference-testing" id="preference-testing">
          <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
            <p>The tests were done online using Usability Hub, where people voted for their preferred design solution.</p>
            <p>For the first one participants chose between chat window designs. Option B scored 67% making it the most popular option.</p>
          <div class="chat-test">
            <a href="project.html"><img id="chat1" src="../images/chat1.png" alt="chat1"></a>
            <a href="project.html"><img id="chat2" src="../images/chat2.png" alt="chat2"></a>
            <a href="project.html"><img id="chat3" src="../images/chat3.png" alt="chat3"></a>
          </div>
            <p>Here, icon designs were tested for the dropdown menu. Options A & C both scored 50%. I chose option A because the icons were easier to see on the white background.</p>
          <div class="dropdown-test">
            <a href="project.html"><img id="dropdown1" src="../images/dropdown1.png" alt="dropdown1"></a>
            <a href="project.html"><img id="dropdown2" src="../images/dropdown2.png" alt="dropdown2"></a>
            <a href="project.html"><img id="dropdown3" src="../images/dropdown3.png" alt="dropdown3"></a>
              <p>I further simplified the design  and made the style more consistent across the icons.</p>
            <a href="project.html"><img id="dropdown4" src="../images/dropdown4.png" alt="dropdown4"></a>
          </div>
            <p>Lastly, visual cues were chosen, which helped the user identify the page or section they were on. Option A scored 50% and was the popular choice.</p>
          <div class="cues-test">
            <a href="project.html"><img id="cue1" src="../images/cue1.png" alt="cue1"></a>
            <a href="project.html"><img id="cue2" src="../images/cue2.png" alt="cue2"></a>

<!--Usability Testing-->
      <section class="usability-testing" id="usability-testing">
        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>Two rounds of online and offline usability tests were run, where users commented on the app and completed all 14 tasks outlined in the user flows.</p>
          <p>The participants had a clear understanding of the website but also pointed out necessary improvement. Their input led me to move the ‘New+’ button higher so it  would be found quicker.</p>
        <a href="project.html"><img id="new-button" src="../images/new-button.png" alt="new-button"></a>
          <p>With their feedback I also regroup the features located on the dashboard navigation bar and let the ‘share’ feature only appear when an item was selected.</p>
        <div class="dashboard-features">
          <a href="project.html"><img id="dash1" src="../images/dash1.png" alt="dash1"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="dash2" src="../images/dash2.png" alt="dash2"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="dash3" src="../images/dash3.png" alt="dash3"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="dash4" src="../images/dash4.png" alt="dash4"></a>
        </div>
         <p>I changed the dashboard icon into the logo so that the user could find their way to the dashboard quicker.</p>
        <div class="document-icon">
          <a href="project.html"><img id="icon1" src="../images/icon1.png" alt="icon1"></a>
          <a href="project.html"><img id="icon2" src="../images/icon2.png" alt="icon2"></a>

        <div class="lessons">
          <h2>Learned lessons...</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To pay attention to the relative size of the components and elements during the beginning stages of the project, especially the base font.</li>
            <li>To pay attention to detail, page folds, color, overlays and to make sure that various features are consistent across screens.</li>
            <li>To reference the user personas and moodboard. The user personas are a great way to direct and prioritize relevant content, while the moodboard was utilized to inform the images and design elements.</li>
            <li>The difference between organizing content on a website vs a dashboard, visual cues, color usage and to reference outside sources frequently to help with decisions.</li>
            <li>The importance of user testing and how it revealed overlooked sections and features, which helped design a more intuitive interface.</li>

        <div class="more-time">
          <h2>With more time...</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Another user survey would have allowed to gather more information from the participants and narrow down the existing data for more effective solutions.</li>
            <li>Doing more preference tests when deciding on the dashboard features, logo and pop-up screen design.</li>
            <li>Conducting another round of usability tests at the beginning stages, when the wireframes were created.</li>
