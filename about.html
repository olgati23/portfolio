          <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>When I was little, I had the desire to catch the environment that surrounded me on a piece of paper. I started taking art classes at age 9.  It became my refuge. While I desired to draw the human body, I had to first study color theory and paint a variety of materials placed around still life objects. Only years later, I finally began to meticulously draw out all the bones in the body. I wished to understand the design of a human by observing its physique. Interestingly, the more I learned about anatomy, the greater my interest in biology became.</p>

          <h3>Science</h3>
            <p>Biology was the field that helped me understand how everything around me worked. I did art and science until the decision came to pick classes for my high school diploma. I chose biology and preceded to start a degree in neuroscience.  Around this time, I became passionate about mental health and eastern meditative practices. Slowly, my study of the body was transformed into a study of the mind.</p>
            <p>In university, I was interested in the data, method and statistics, but I never fit the mold of a scientific researcher. The lack of creativity and visual design didn’t let me rest.</p>
            <p>Through learning about the Carnegie Mellon School of Design and going to Schumacher’s College Transition Design Symposium I was exposed to the power of design as a means for societal transformation and social innovation. This sparked my interest and inspired my transition from science to design.</p>

          <h3>Volunteering & Travel</h3>
            <p>Working with children in roles of a team leader and teacher have taught me to think quickly and be decisive. Helping children learn was extremely rewarding and led me to seek opportunities to help others.  I volunteered in Ecuador, Brazil and India in an array of projects. From helping underprivileged children and women to working with education initiatives and applying ecological design principles to agricultural practice as a means of community empowerment. During this time, my passion for solving human problems and being of service to others grew radically.</p>

          <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>For me, design is the melting pot of my life’s passions. It allows me to be creative and technical, adhere to frameworks and make bold choices. Additionally, it enables me to connect with a diverse set of professionals and work together to solve current problems. It excites me that design has the ability to positively transform individuals, organizations and communities.</p>
